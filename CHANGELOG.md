# Changelog

All notable changes to AlleleForge are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The
project is in the `0.x` series until the three launch modalities pass
acceptance.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Phase 0 — Repository bootstrap.** Hatchling build, `aforge` console-script
  entry point, dependency groups (`core`/`genome`/`variant`/`ml`/`web`/`docs`/`dev`),
  pinned tool configuration (ruff line-length 100; mypy `strict`; pytest with an
  85% coverage gate). Rust PyO3 crate `aforge_native` (built with maturin)
  exposing `version()` to prove the toolchain end to end. Single-source version
  in `_version.py`; typed `Settings` (pydantic-settings) carrying every
  cross-cutting default (seed `20240501`, reference `hg38`, 80% interval level,
  MAF threshold `0.001`, XDG cache dir). MIT license for all code, schemas,
  benchmark, and first-party weights; `CITATION.cff`, Contributor
  Covenant 2.1 code of conduct, contributing guide, multi-stage `Dockerfile`,
  `docker-compose.yml` stub, conda environment file, and a GitHub Actions CI
  matrix (lint, type-check, test, Rust build, docs).
- **Phase 1 — Core domain types & schemas.** The typed vocabulary under
  `alleleforge.types`: strand-aware `DNASequence` with ambiguity-aware
  reverse-complement, `GenomicInterval` (0-based half-open), `Variant` with
  idempotent normalization, guide/pegRNA/nicking-guide models with structural
  validation, edit-outcome and strategy models, off-target site/report models
  with ancestry stratification, the generic `Prediction[T]` uncertainty
  contract (80% interval, method tag, in-distribution and calibration flags),
  design-candidate and ranked-menu models, and the provenance block. JSON
  Schemas for every public model are emitted to `docs/schemas/`.
- **Phase 2 — Genome access & indexing.** `alleleforge.genome`: a strand-aware,
  bounds-checked `ReferenceGenome` over pyfaidx that N-pads contig ends and
  flags the over-run rather than crashing, with a registry of built-in builds
  (hg38, T2T-CHM13 v2, mm39) and consent-gated, checksum-verified download; a
  content-addressed, memory-mapped FM-index (with a correct pure-Python fallback
  when the Rust kernels are not built) for PAM-anchored candidate search; and
  cross-build liftover plus `flag_ambiguous_regions()`, which recommends
  T2T-CHM13 for segmentally-duplicated / centromeric / hg38-difficult loci and
  wires the recommendation into the Phase 1 result types.
- **Phase 3 — Data registry & population datasets.** `alleleforge.data`: a
  license-aware, versioned `DatasetRegistry` that never vendors a
  non-redistributable source and refuses to fetch an artifact it cannot
  checksum-verify; ClinVar parsing into normalized variants with
  significance/review-status and `get`/`by_rsid`/`by_gene`/`in_region` lookups;
  gnomAD per-population allele-frequency queries; 1000 Genomes and HGDP phased
  common-haplotype enumeration; dbSNP rsID ↔ locus resolution; and GENCODE gene
  models plus ENCODE bedGraph signal lookups. Every parser reads plain-text
  fixtures so CI needs no `pysam`/`cyvcf2`. Dataset versions, licenses, and
  citations are documented in `docs/data.md`.
- **Phase 4 — Variant resolver.** `alleleforge.variant`: `resolve(...)` turns a
  ClinVar accession, dbSNP rsID, HGVS (`g.`/`c.`/`p.`), VCF record, raw
  coordinates, or a raw target sequence into one canonical, **left-aligned**,
  reference-validated `Variant` (a ref/reference disagreement is a hard error)
  with its working interval and molecular consequence. Includes a
  dependency-free genomic-HGVS parser, an `HgvsAdapter` that projects coding /
  protein expressions through an injected backend, and a VEP-style
  `EffectPredictor` protocol with a deterministic static implementation.
- **Phase 5 — Off-target engine (population & haplotype aware).**
  `alleleforge.offtarget`: a five-stage [`search`][] — reference candidate
  search (PAM-anchored, ≤4 mismatches, ≤1 DNA + ≤1 RNA bulge, both strands;
  Rust FM-index with a correct linear-scan fallback), gnomAD **population
  augmentation** that finds *de novo* PAMs and strengthened seed-mismatch sites,
  **haplotype-aware** walking of common 1000G/HGDP haplotypes, an optional
  patient-VCF pass, then CFD+MIT scoring, thresholding (CFD ≥ 0.20 or MIT ≥ 0.10),
  de-duplication, and **ancestry stratification by default**. Published MIT/Hsu
  and CFD scorers (the exact Doench PAM table; an injectable mismatch table) plus
  a Cas12a CFD analog, behind a swappable `OffTargetScorer` protocol; an optional
  Cas-OFFinder cross-check. The reference-bias / `rs114518452` finding is
  reproduced as an integration test: a reference-only scan is blind to the
  ancestry-enriched off-target the population-aware scan nominates. Cites
