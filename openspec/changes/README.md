# Change proposals — bulletproofing & enhancement

These proposals harden and enhance AlleleForge's existing features. Each was derived from
a close reading of the current code (with `file:line` evidence in its `proposal.md`) and
targets a real gap between what a capability *claims* and what it currently *guarantees*.
The recurring theme: the strong mechanisms already exist (checksum verify, calibrated
intervals, seed, provenance) but are not yet fully wired into the real paths. Closing
those wiring gaps — more than adding new machinery — is what makes the tool trustworthy
enough for a bench scientist to adopt.

## Priority order

Ranked by scientific trust impact. Do the top group before any public distribution.

| # | Change | Capabilities | Why it matters |
|---|--------|--------------|----------------|
| ✅ | `harden-uncertainty-honesty` *(shipped — see `archive/`)* | uncertainty-contract, candidate-ranking | The `calibrated`/OOD flags are honor-system and ranking ignores them — the core "honest uncertainty" promise is not enforced end to end. |
| ✅ | `bulletproof-offtarget-nomination` *(shipped — see `archive/`)* | offtarget-nomination, native-kernels | The differentiator can under-state risk (first- not best-alignment) and mis-place indel-derived hits. Correctness here is the whole value proposition. |
| 3 | `ship-published-cfd-matrix` | offtarget-scoring, reporting | The default CFD uses an approximation, not the published matrix — out-of-the-box scores are not the CFD numbers users expect. |
| ✅ | `validate-oligo-alphabet` *(shipped — see `archive/`)* | oligo-output | `revcomp` silently mis-complements non-DNA input, producing a wrong wet-lab reagent. Safety-critical, cheap to fix. |
| 5 | `verify-artifact-integrity` | model-zoo, data-registry, genome-access | Cached checkpoints/datasets are trusted without re-verification and 12/13 cards are unpinned — the checksum gate is bypassed on every cache hit. |
| 6 | `complete-provenance` | provenance-reproducibility, cli | Design provenance under-reports datasets/tools, the seed drives no RNG, and the CLI ignores the config file — "re-derivable from provenance" is only partly true. |
| 7 | `align-prime-coverage` | prime-editor-design, candidate-ranking | Routing advertises prime for edit classes enumeration cannot produce, so the flagship silently under-delivers. |
| 8 | `harden-web-api` | web-api | No auth/rate-limit/size cap and an unbounded, non-durable job store — unsafe to expose beyond localhost. |
| ✅ | `guard-benchmark-integrity` *(shipped — see `archive/`; optional metric hardening deferred)* | benchmark-harness, reporting | Split disjointness is never enforced and results carry no schema version — leaderboard trust rests on invariants that aren't checked. |

Each change folder contains `proposal.md` (Why / What Changes / Impact), `tasks.md` (an
ordered checklist), and `specs/<capability>/spec.md` (the ADDED/MODIFIED requirement
deltas). When a change ships, fold its deltas into `specs/` and archive the folder.
